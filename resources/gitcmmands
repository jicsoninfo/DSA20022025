//To clone the master branch:
git clone -b master https://github.com/username/repository.git
git clone -b main https://github.com/username/repository.git
git branch -a

//If you've already cloned the repository but want to switch between branches (e.g., from main to master or vice versa), you can use the git checkout command:
git checkout master
git checkout main

//If the branch doesnâ€™t exist locally yet, you can fetch the remote branches and check out the desired branch:

git fetch
git checkout master  # Or 'main'


//If you are unsure which branches are available on the remote repository, you can check by running:
git ls-remote --heads https://github.com/username/repository.git
